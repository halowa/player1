Hello everyone!
I am a graduate of University of Toronto where I studied statistics, mathematics and biology. I have interests in machine learning and it's applications in real world examples especially climate change and animal populations over time. In the future I hope to use my knowledge of statistics in solving problems posed by climate change for the general population. 
Currently I'm working with free data off Kaggle! If there are any comments that you may have about my code such as areas of improvement or general opinons feel free to send them my way. I'm always looking to learn new methods and perspectives on data! 

### Have a great day!
