Hello everyone.
I am a graduate of University of Toronto where I studied statistics, mathematics and biology. I have interests in machine learning and it's applications in real world examples especially climate change and animal popultions over time. In the future I hope to use my knowledge of statistics in solving problems posed by climate change for the general population.
